    - can bring one 8.5"x11" sheet of handwritten notes (both sides)

//////////////////////////////////////

Intro and elimination rules for existential quantifier (there exists)


//////////////////////////////////

Idea behind there exists-introduction (∃i):

        P(v)
∃i: --------------
       ∃x P(x)

//v is some individual




Human(Socrates)

E x (Human(x))

If we find ONE individual in a domain where a statement holds

...then THERE EXISTS an individual in the domain where the
    statement holds


/////////////////////////////////

Example:

Human(Socrates) |- E x (Human(x))



Example:

A x (Human(x)->Mortal(x)), Human(Socrates) |- E x (Mortal(x))



//////////////////////////////////

Idea behind there exists-elimination (∃e):

                { a P(a)    assume
     ∃x P(x),    ... Q }
∃e: ------------------------------
                  Q

//think of a as an alias for the individual the E statement held for
//a is "fresh" (never used before)


If we know there is at least one individual where some statement holds

...then we can introduce a (or whatever) as an ALIAS for that
    individual in a subproof

    ...whatever conclusion we reach in the subproof must be true
        overall, since a was an EXISTING individual



Structure of the subproof:

3. E x P (x)
4. {
    5. a P(a)       assume //plug into your E statement
    ...
    10. Q
}
11. Q               Ee 3 4



**If you have an E statement as a premise, you almost always
want to start with a block where you create an alias (e.g. a)
and plug it into your E statement, as above

///////////////////////////////

Examples:

A x (Human(x)->Mortal(x)), E x (Human(x)) |- E x (Mortal(x))


E x (P(x)) |-E y (P(y))



∃x (P(x) V Q(x)) ⊢ (∃x P(x)) V (∃x Q(x))


A x (Q(x) -> H(x)), E x (P(x) ^ Q(x)) ⊢ ∃ x (P(x) ^ H(x))


E x (!P(x) ^ !Q(x)) |- E x (!(P(x) V Q(x)))

Proof tactics for predicate logic

- see if you can do anything right away with the premises
    (you probably can't)

- look at top-level operator for what you are trying to prove
    trying to prove A x (P(x)):
        probably want Ai
        open a subproof, introduce fresh a
        try to get to P(a)
        after subproof, use Ai to conclude A x (P(x))


    trying to prove E x (P(x)):
        usually have a E statement as a premise
        have a subproof, make an alias for your E premise and plug it in,
        get to E x (P(x)) by last line of subproof
        after subproof, restate E x (P(x)) with Ee
        no E? Do you have an V statement? Use Ve.

    trying to prove ->
        subproof
        assume left side
        get to right side by end of subproof
        use ->i afterwards to conclude left -> right


    trying to prove !(something)
        subproof
        assume something
        get to contradiction by end of subproof
        afterwards, conclude !(something) with !i


    trying to prove ^
        think of the two sides as separate proofs


    trying to prove an V
        can you get just one side? use Vi
        do you have an V statement? Use Ve.
        do you have a E statement? use Ee with a subproof.


    when you are in a subproof, think about what you are trying
    to prove. Find its top-level operator, approach as above.


Unsure what to do?
    - Do you have an V statement available? Use Ve.

    - Do you have an E statement available? Use Ee

    - Is negation involved, but not creating !(something)?
        try pbc.

Equivalences in predicate logic:

example sentences in English

P(x): person x attends K-State
Q(x): person x attends KU


¬ (∃x P(x)) is equivalent to ∀x ¬ P(x)
There is no person who attends K-State
All people don't attend K-State.

***(stopped here)***



¬ (∀x P(x)) is equivalent to ∃x ¬ P(x)




A x P(x) -> !Q(x) is equivalent to !(E x P(x) ^ Q(x))
