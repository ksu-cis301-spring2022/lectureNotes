HW 7 due Thursday, March 10
    (I recommend completing before the exam)

Exam 2 will be Thursday, March 10
    - 9:30-10:45 am
    - can bring one 8.5"x11" sheet of handwritten notes (both sides)

//////////////////////////////////////

Multiple variables/quantifiers

P(x, y): person x likes person y

(everybody likes everybody)

A x (A y P(x, y)) |- A y (A x P(y, x))



////////////////////////////////////////


E x (E y P(x, y)) |- E y (E x(P(x, y))



///////////////////////////////////////////////


A x (A y C(x) -> D(y)), E x C(x)  |- A y D(y)


////////////////////////////////////////////

Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.


Soundness: definition?
    propositional: Everything we could prove (with proof rules) is actually true
    predicate logic: is sound


Completeness: definition?
    propositional: Everything that is true (with truth tables) can be proved
    predicate logic is not complete

propositional: sound and complete
predicate: sound, not complete

///////////////////////////////////

Domain with integers, where predicates are different arithmetic operations

maybe predicate is addition. 2 + 3 = 5

maybe domain is: 0,1,2,3,4

       2 + 3 = 0


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be statements that
can be neither proved nor disproved.

(depends on interpretations)



Decidability - whether a problem can be decided one way or another

Halting problem - given a computer program and a set of inputs
    can you write another program to determine if the original
        program will halt for the inputs

////////////////////////////////////////

- Finishing propositional logic
    - Proof by contradiction (pbc) and bottom elimination (_|_e) rules
    - Semantic entailment (a |= b)
        truth tables
        anytime a is true, then b is also true
        show a->b is a tautology
        (or show that any truth assignment that makes a true also be makes b true)
    - Proving theorems
        a V !a
        a proof with no premises
        |- (theorem)
    - Satisfiability
        p -> q
        p = T, q = T, then p->q is true
        (there is some truth assignment that makes it true)
    - Soundness and completeness
        (just definitions, what is true for prop./pred logic)
    - Showing equivalence using both truth tables and proofs
        truth tables: same set of truth assignments make both true
        prove A |- B and B |- A
    - Showing a sequent is invalid
        A |- B
        invalid if there is a truth assignment that makes premises true
            but conclusion false
- Predicate logic
    - Translating between English and predicate logic
    - Proofs in predicate logic (including Ai, Ae, Ei, and Ee rules),
        including proofs with nested quantifiers
    - Showing equivalence using proofs
    - Explain proof rules
    - Maybe, do translations first and then prove your translations
- Mathematical induction
