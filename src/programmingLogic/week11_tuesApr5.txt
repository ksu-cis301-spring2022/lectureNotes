HW 9 due Thursday, April 7

Email me if you want the link for any previous lecture
    (let me know which lecture date you would like)

(Or if you need to miss, let me know and I'll send you
the link after class)

/////////////////////////////////

Absolute value

/////////////////////////////////

Max of 3

- look at code file first
- then look at verification file

////////////////////////////////

Next up: validating programs with functions

- look at "plus one" code

////////////////////////////////

Function contracts - just under function definition:

l"""{
    requires (precondition)
    modifies (list of variables)
    ensures (postcondition)
}"""


Requires (precondition):
- any assumptions we need to make about the parameters
- can have several preconditions -- put on the next lines, tabbed over


Modifies:
- list any sequences or global variables modified by this function
- we won't be using until we get to sequences


Ensures/postcondition:
- describes what the function returns
    result == (describe the value being returned)
- describes any changes the function makes to sequences/globals
- can have several postconditions -- put on the next lines, tabbed over

/////////////////////////////////

What do we need to show before calling a function?
- you must show that the precondition (requires) are true


What can we list as a premise just inside a function?
- you can list the precondition as a premise in the function body




What do we need to show before returning from a function?
- need to prove the postcondition
    (show you are returning what you say you will)



What can we list as a premise just after calling a function?
- the postcondition



/////////////////////////////////

Write function contract for plusOne

Prove the postcondition for plusOne

Validate the assert after calling plusOne

/////////////////////////////////

Example: getTicketCosts
(we'll do on Thursday)

- find the total cost of tickets based on adult/child numbers
- each adult ticket is $50, and each child ticket is $30

- what do we need as preconditions?


- what should be the postcondition?

--> write the code
--> prove the postcondition
--> write test code to call getTicketCosts
--> add an assert
--> validate the assert
