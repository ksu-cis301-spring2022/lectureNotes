I'll hand exam 2 back on Tuesday
    (grades should be in Canvas by sometime tomorrow)

HW 8 will be posted later today
    -> due Thursday, March 31

///////////////////////////////////////

Why have we been learning logic proof rules? What does that
have to do with computer science?








/////////////////////////////

Rest of course: programming logic

Apply proof techniques and similar reasoning to prove correctness
of basic programs.

(Why does this matter?)







////////////////////////////

Our Logika programs are a subset of Scala
    - variables (boolean, int, sequences)
    - printing and user input
    - math operations
    - conditional operations
    - if and if/else statements
    - while loops
    - functions


Basic Logika program #1
    - get user input number, add one to it, print it out

Basic Logika program #2
    - get user input number, print whether it is positive or negative

Basic Logika program #3
    - use a loop to print the numbers from 10 down to 1

Basic Logika program #4
    - write a separate function to add all elements in a sequence
    - create a sequence, call the function, print the result






////////////////////////

assume statements
    - preconditions
    - things we need to be true about user input or parameters

assume(something about the input)

assert statements
    - postconditions
    - things we want to claim are true after some code
    - we need to PROVE these claims

in Java/C#: will run the code, like:
assert(methodCall(...) == something)

For us: we need to have already proved what we are claiming


What is our goal with an assert statement?



How are Logika asserts different from C# (and other languages)?





////////////////////////

Process of validating a simple program:



get user input / set initial variable values

assume statements to specify what must be true about the input

program statement

(claims - use logic blocks to evaluate what has happened)

program statement

(claims - use logic blocks to evaluate what has happened)

program statement

(claims - must include what we need in our asserts [exactly])

any assert statements to sum up what happened







///////////////////////////////

Claims go in "logic blocks", which look like:

l"""{
    //line numbers with claims and justifications
    //similar to prop/pred logic proofs

    x. claim            justification lineNumbers
}"""

//////////////////////////////

Justifications:

premise
    - something from an assume
    - a program assignment that was just executed
        (use == to show equality in the claim)
    - something shown in a previous logic block


algebra
    - any algebraic manipulation on a previous claim
    - include all relevant line numbers in whatever order
        (might be zero or 3+)

ANY of your propositional/predicate logic justifications
    (especially ^e1, ^e2, ^i, Vi1, Vi2)




//////////////////////////////

Example: assume1.logika
    - get input number, assumed to be > 0
    - verify that the input number is > -1


When do we need a claim? What are we keeping track of?

In order to make an assert, must end last logic block
    with a claim that exactly matches the assert


If you want an AND (^), put & in the assert

If you want an OR (V), put | in the assert


//////////////////////////////

Example: write a program that creates a number, x, with value 2
(add2.logika)

Create a value, y, that is initialized to x + 2

We want to assert at the end that y is 4

Write the necessary logic blocks




--> How could we also assert that x is still 2 using ONE assert?





//////////////////////////////

Example (maxInput.logika):

get 2 user inputs: x and y
assume that x > y
set a max variable to x

want to assert that max >= x and max >= y







//////////////////////////////

The algebra justification works for most mathematical manipulations

Will not work on claims involving ∧, ∨, →, ⊥, ∀, ∃

Another justification: subst









/////////////////////////////

subst1 m n

l"""{
    ...
    m. LHS_M == RHS_M
    ...
    n. LHS_N == RHS_N
    ...
    x. (claim)              subst1 m n
}"""

(claim) rewrites claim n by substituting all occurrences of
    LHS_M with RHS_M


Example:

l"""{
    ...
    m. x + 1 == y - 4
    ...
    n. x*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y
    ...
    x. x*(y - 4) == (y - 4) + y            subst1 m n
}






/////////////////////////////

subst2 m n

l"""{
    ...
    m. LHS_M == RHS_M
    ...
    n. LHS_N == RHS_N
    ...
    x. (claim)              subst2 m n
}

(claim) rewrites claim n by substituting all occurrences of
    RHS_M with LHS_M


Example:

l"""{
    ...
    m. x + 1 == y
    ...
    n. y*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + y
    ...
    x. (x + 1)*(x + 1) == (x + 1) + (x + 1)             subst2 m n
}





/////////////////////////////////

Example (substPractice.logika):

make a value x set to 4
make a value y set to x + 2
make a value z set to x + 2

want to assert that y and z are the same






//////////////////////////////

Example: fill in justifications (missingJustifications.logika)

First, try with no algebra rules

Then, redo using algebra

(I usually use the algebra justification, if either works)







//////////////////////////////

assignment with mutation

if you change the value of a variable, want to add this claim
    to the next logic block:

x = x + 3
l"""{
    1. x == x_old + 3               premise

}"""

The name_old refers to the OLD value of the variable, just before
the latest update.

By the end of the next logic block, want to state what the
variable's current value is WITHOUT using the _old value
(it won't be available after the next logic block)





//////////////////////

Example (add3total.logika):

- get an input number
- save out an "orig" value that is equal to the input

add 1 to the input number
add 2 to the input number

want to assert that the resulting number is 3 more than the orig value



--> what if we added an assume that the input number was positive?
--> could we add to our assert that the resulting number is positive?

Look at HW 8

-> should be able to do numbers 1-4 now
-> what do the programs do?
-> note on #4 about dividing by 0
