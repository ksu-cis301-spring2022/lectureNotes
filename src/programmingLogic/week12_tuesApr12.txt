HW 10 due Thursday, April 14

////////////////////////////////////

We proved using mathematical induction that:

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2nâˆ’1) = n^2

(the sum of the odd numbers up to 2n-1 equals n^2)

- write a recursive function to calculate this sum

- verify it

////////////////////////////////

Validating loops.

while (condition) {
    statements
}

We want to be able to make claims about our program after loop
is done
    ...but we don't know how many times it will execute
    ...or even IF it will execute

//////////////////////////////

Solution: kind of like mathematical induction

Come up with a loop INVARIANT that summarizes the behavior
in a loop

invariant should be true when loop begins
should be STILL true at the end of each iteration

1) Prove the invariant is true before the loop begins
    (what is this like in mathematical induction?)

2) Assume the invariant is true at the beginning of an iteration.
    Prove the invariant still holds at the end of the iteration.
    (what is this like in mathematical induction?)


/////////////////////////

When you exit a loop, you know two things:
    1) What about the invariant?

    2) What about the loop condition?


If your loop is in a function, you can use those two pieces
to prove the postcondition of the function.

/////////////////////////

Loop invariant block: just inside the loop

while (condition) {
    l"""{
        invariant (list the invariant[s])
        modifies (list all variables modified in the loop)
    }"""

    code for the loop
}


/////////////////////////

Example: multiplication by repeated addition, using a loop

See the code.


Verification steps:
1) Add a function contract
2) Add a loop invariant block
3) Prove the invariant is true before the loop begins
4) Assume the invariant is true at the start of an iteration.
    Prove it is still true at the end of the iteration.
5) Prove the postcondition after the loop ends.
    !(condition) and the invariant are premises


If you have calling code:
1) Prove the precondition in the calling code before
    calling the function.
2) Use the postcondition as a premise in the calling code after
    calling the function.
