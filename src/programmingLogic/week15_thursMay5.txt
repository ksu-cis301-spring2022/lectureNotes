HW 13 (last HW) due tonight

Final exam: Tuesday, May 10, 2:00-3:50 pm

Soudabeh will hold an additional review session -
    Monday, May 9 from 9:00 am - 12:00 pm

Office hour times will be different next week --
    I'll send an announcement with all the changes tomorrow

Please fill out a TEVAL if you haven't already

Termination

Partial Correctness:
    - if the function/procedure’s pre-condition holds,
    - AND if it terminates,
    - THEN its post-condition is guaranteed

Total Correctness:
    - if the function/procedure’s pre-condition holds,
    - THEN it terminates,
    - AND its post-condition is guaranteed


We need to show termination to achieve total correctness


////////////////////////

Proving termination.

We want to show:
    - The decreasing amount of work left to do
    - An indication of when the work is done

Use an integer to show the (decreasing) amount of work left
    - Each loop iteration decreases the integer
    - 0 means we are done (no more work)
    - If the integer is 0 (or less), then the loop should exit

//////////////////////////

Recall mult (slightly modified).

Will it necessarily terminate?



- Add measure tracking how much work is left
- Compute measure before and after loop body
- Prove that the measure decreases with each iteration
    (add an assert)
- Prove that if the measure is 0 or less, then the loop exits
    (might need to strengthen to invariant)


Note that proving termination isn't always possible...

See Collatz problem.

Halting problem - undecidable


/////////////////////////////////////

Final exam.

Cumulative.
Similar format as the midterms exams (multiple choice + open-ended).
Can bring one 8.5"x11" sheet of handwritten notes.

- Introduction to logical reasoning
    - Basic logical reasoning
    - Knights and knaves puzzles
- Propositional logic
    - Translating between English and propositional logic
    - Truth tables, top-level operators,
            tautology/contingent/contradictory, satisfiability
    - Propositional logic proofs
        and, or, implies, and negation rules
    - Semantic entailment (uses truth tables)
        p semantically entails q if p->q is a tautology
    - Logical equivalence (with proofs and with truth tables)
    - Soundness and completeness
        soundness: anything that I can prove (with proof rules)
                    is actually true

        completeness: everything that is true can be proved
- Predicate logic
    - Universal and existential quantifiers
    - Translating between English and predicate logic
    - Predicate logic proofs with Ai, Ae, Ei, and Ee rules
        (including those with more than one variable
        and/or nested quantifiers)
- Programming logic (I'll specify manual/symexe for each problem)
    - Assumes and asserts
    - The subst rules
    - The algebra rule
    - Verifying asserts with variables/expressions/updating variables
        (including claims with division and modulus)
    - Verifying programs with if/else statements, functions,
        loops, recursion, sequences, and global variables/invariants
    - Function contracts
    - Loop invariant blocks
    - Verifying "test code" that calls a function
    - Interpreting and using Logika facts
    - Full vs. partial correctness, and proving termination


I strongly recommend reworking previous exams,
going through previous exam review problems, and reworking
previous homework problems.

These practice problems do not cover all exam topics.
