HW 3 due Thursday, February 10
    (HW 4 will be posted then, due
    Thursday, February 16)

Exam 1: Thursday, February 10
    This room
    9:30-10:45 am
    No notes/no computers

** I strongly recommend finishing the homework before
    the exam -- it will help you review **

    Exam prep help / HW 3 questions

HW submission: MUST be in specified format

..../tree/(digital fingerprint)

Received a warning on HW 1/HW 2

On future homeworks, links in wrong format will get a 0

///////////////////////////////

How do you think we could prove a sequent using truth
    tables?

Example:

    p ^ q |- p->q

plug in all truth assignments for premises
    p^q

want to show that those truth assignments also make
    the conclusion true

(p^q) -> (p->q)

want this statement to be a tautology

///////////////////////////////

Proving arguments in English.

Suppose we know:

If it is raining or snowing, then it is muddy.
It is snowing.

We want to prove: It is muddy.

p: it is raining
q: it is snowing
r: it is muddy

p V q -> r, q |- r
{
    1. p V q -> r           premise
    2. q                    premise
    3. p V q                Vi2 2
    4. r                    ->e 1 3
}

//////////////////////////////

Last propositional logic proof rules.

(NOT on exam 1 -- but are needed for HW 4)

Bottom-elimination:

          _|_
_|_e:  ----------
           R


Proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum):

       {!P assume
        ... _|_}
pbc:  ----------
          P

//////////////////////////

Demonstrate _|_e rule:

p V q, !q, |- p
{
    1. p V q                    premise
    2. !q                       premise
    3. {
        4. p                    assume
    }
    5. {
        6. q                    assume
        7. _|_                  !e 6 2
        8. p                    _|_e 7
    }
    9. p                        Ve 1 3 5
}

(what do we do with V statements in a premise?)

Not used as much - just when you need to pull
    something out of nothing

//////////////////////////

Demonstrate pbc rule (opposite of !i):

!!p |- p
{
    1. !!p              premise
    2. {
        3. !p           assume
        4. _|_          !e 3 1
    }
    5. p                pbc 2
}


Not used as much as !i, and harder to detect:
    If you need to prove something involving negation,
    and it doesn't fit another pattern, try pbc

//////////////////////////

Exam review.

Closed notes/computers.
Please sit every other chair.

Topics:
- basic logical reasoning (multiple choice)
- logic puzzles (multiple choice)
- truth tables
- translating to propositional logic
- proofs in propositional logic (AND, OR, IMPLIES,
    !i, !e rules)

Multiple choice section + open-ended section

10 multiple choice, 6 open-ended (probably)

//////////////////////////////

Types of multiple choice problems:
- basic logical reasoning (like day 1)
- logic puzzles (knights and knaves, etc.)
- logical operator precedence
- top-level operator
- other truth table concepts (plugging in T/F values,
    seeing if something is contradictory/contingent/
    tautology, satisfiability (at least one truth
    assignment makes the formula true),
    seeing whether two statements are equivalent)
- translating an English sentence to propositional logic
- what different proof rules do, best approaches to starting a
    proof, what justification matches a proof step)

/////////////////////////////////////

Types of open-ended problems:
- completing a truth table (including marking the top-level
    operator and classifying the formula as contradictory/
    contingent/tautology)
- explaining any of the proof rules we've seen
    - in what situation can they be used?
    - what is the process of using them?
    - why does the rule "make sense" as something we can do?
- finding errors in a proof I give you
- adding either claims or justification to complete a
        partial proof
- completing full propositional logic proofs
- proofs on English arguments (translation, then proof)

//////////////////////////////////////

How to study

- memorize the truth tables for all operators (!, ^, V, ->)
- memorize the rules for order of operations
    which operators are processed first?
        (), !, ^, V, ->
    if multiple of the same operator, which is first?
        ^, V: left to right
        -> right to left
        ! right to left
    which is the top-level operator?
- memorize the format of Logika truth tables
- memorize the usage of all proof rules we've covered
    ^i, ^e1, ^e2, Vi1, Vi2, Ve, ->e, ->i, !e, !i
    look at online "proof guide"
- finish HW 3 before the exam
- complete all quiz problems
- rework homework problems without looking at the solutions
- rework all examples from lecture
    (without looking at solutions)

Review - exam 1 from Fall 2021

(this exam did NOT include !i, !e - refer to HW 3
    to study for these questions)
