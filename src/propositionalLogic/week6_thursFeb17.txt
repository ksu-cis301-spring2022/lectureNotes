HW 4 due tonight
    - some of them have hints
    ...but you are welcome to solve them in a different way

HW submission: MUST be in specified format
    ..../tree/(digital fingerprint)
    or will receive a 0

HW 5 will be posted later today
    involves concepts from today's class

////////////////////////////////////

P1, ..., Pn |- C

the premises together with the conclusion
    is a sequent

P1, ..., PN *prove* C


///////////////////////////////////

A sequent is *invalid* if there exists a truth assignment
that makes the premises true but the conclusion false



Example:

p → q, r -> q |- ¬r → ¬p

Is the sequent valid?

What would make ¬r → ¬p false?

r would need to be false, p would need to be true

p = T
q = T
r = F







///////////////////////////////////

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises. For example,
LEM is a theorem:

|- p V !p


The LEM theorem is p V !p.

|- (theorem that you are trying to prove)

//////////////////////////////////

Example: prove the following theorem:

(p -> q) -> ((!p -> q) -> q)





///////////////////////////////////

Semantic entailment.

P1, ..., Pn |= C

P1, ..., Pn ENTAILS C

if whenever P1, ..., Pn are true in a truth table, then
C is also true.

IF each Pi is true, THEN we promise C is true

How could we write this in a truth table?

(P1 ^ ... ^ Pn) -> C

What kind of truth table would it need to be?

tautology


/////////////////////////////////////

Example: proofs with truth tables

Show that the premises entail the conclusion:

p V q |= (p V r) V (q V r)

using ONE truth table

(p V q) -> (p V r) V (q V r)


should be a tautology




/////////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of propositional logic

SOUNDNESS: everything that is provable is actually true

everything we can prove with our proof rules is
also true in truth tables


COMPLETENESS: everything that is true is provable

everything we can show is true in a truth table
can also be proved with our proof rules

What would it meant to be sound and complete?



//////////////////////////////////////

Propositional logic is SOUND, because whenever we use
natural deduction to prove

P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q

we can also use truth tables to show that

(P1 ^ ... ^ Pn) -> q

is a tautology


Proof idea:

^e1 rule lets us have p ^ q |- p


Does p ^ q |= p?

(p ^ q) -> p


p, q |- p ^ q (this is ^i)

(p ^ q) -> (p ^ q)


Would need to show this with all proof rules.

What about bottom elimination, _|_e?

_|_ |- anything! (_|_e rule)

Does _|_ |= (anything)?

_|_ -> (anything)

////////////////////////////////////////

Propositional logic is COMPLETE, because whenever we
use truth tables to show that

(P1 ^ ... ^ Pn) -> q

is a tautology (that P1, ..., Pn |= q)

we can also use natural deduction to prove

P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q

...idea involves turning each line of a truth table
    into a sequent

relies heavily on LEM (p V !p)



///////////////////////////////////////

Provable equivalence

Two propositional logic statements S1, S2 are
*provably equivalent* if and only if:

S1 |- S2
S2 |- S1






/////////////////////////

Semantic equivalence

Two propositional logic statements S1, S2 are
    *semantically equivalent* if and only if:

(S1 -> S2 ) ^ (S2 -> S1)




/////////////////////////

Example:

First formula: (p → ¬ q)
Second formula: ¬ (p ∧ q)

Show that they are provably equivalent




Show that they are semantically equivalent

First formula: (p → ¬ q)
Second formula: ¬ (p ∧ q)

((p → ¬ q) -> ¬ (p ∧ q)) ^ (¬ (p ∧ q) -> (p → ¬ q))

that needs to be a tautology

(or you could do two separate truth tables, one
for each implication, both would be tautologies)


/////////////////////////


How do you think Logika works?
    ...for truth tables?



    ...for proofs?


How does this relate to compilers?

/////////////////////////////////

Limitations of propositional logic:

All humans are mortal.
Socrates is human.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.


p: All humans are mortal
q: Socrates is a human
r: Socrates is mortal

p, q |- r

How would we prove this is propositional logic?

///////////////

Predicate logic:

Instead of propositions, we will break statements into:

verbs: predicates
nouns: individuals
quantifiers: specifying all individuals /
        at least one individual





///////////////

Domains: a set of individuals
(then we can make claims about different domains)

For example:
    ...the domain of all animals
    ...the domain of all people
    ...the domain of all states
    ...the domain of all college classes


Individuals are elements within a particular domain

For example:
    "Bob" might be an individual within the domain
        of all people
    "Kansas" is an individual within the domain of states
    "CIS 301" is an individual within the domain
        of all college classes





//////////////////

Predicate:
- a function that returns a boolean
- can have one or many parameters
- parameters are individuals in a particular domain

A predicate will describe a characteristic of
    an individual, or a comparison between
    multiple individuals


Example:
    Domain: people
    Maybe Alice, Bob, and Carla are individuals in
        the domain

    isAdult(takes a person)
    isMotherOf(person 1, person 2) - return whether
                person 1 is the mother of person2

    isTallerThan(person 1, person2) - return whether
                person 2 is taller than person 2

    isAdult(Alice) might be true (maybe Alice is 35)
    isAdult(Bob) might be false (Bob is 10)
    isMotherOf(Alice, Bob) might be true
    isMotherOf(Carla, Bob) might be false
    isTallerThan(Carla, Alice) might true


A x isAdult(x) - all people are adults
E x isAdult(x) - there exists a person who is an adult


/////////////////

∀ quantifier: for all (something is true FOR ALL
    elements in a domain)

∃ quantifier: there exists (THERE EXISTS at least one
    element in a domain where something is true)

∀ n P(n) means: for every individual n (in some domain),
    P(n) is true

∃ n P(n) means: there exists at least one individual n
    (in some domain) where P(n) is true



//////////////

Domain: people

    inCIS_301(x) - person x is in CIS 301
    tookExam1(x) - person x took exam 1


∀ x inCIS_301(x)  --> what does this mean?

All people are in CIS 301


∃ x tookExam1(x) --> what does this mean?

There is a person who took exam 1




∀ x (inCIS_301(x) ^ tookExam1(x)) --> what does this mean?

All people are in CIS 301 and took exam 1
(probably not want I want to say)

How would we say: all people in CIS 301 took Exam 1?

∀ x (inCIS_301(x) -> tookExam1(x))

All people in CIS 301 took exam 1


What do you notice about the ∀ quantifier?

want the -> operator

How would we say: there is a person in CIS 301
    who took exam 1?

E x (inCIS_301(x) ^ tookExam1(x))

with E quantifier, use ^ to connect
